There are few manual steps to be followed before uploading the final metadata to sales and service cloud after using automated conversion feature and downloading the converted file:

- Validate if the converted metadata downloaded after conversion is correct and valid. There can be inconsistencies and discrepencies with current scope. Correct if any details to be changed as per the guidelines provided to upload a custom service metadata to sales and service cloud `[Link to custom services documentation to be provided here]`.
- As the first entity defined in CAP service metadata uploaded will be considered as `root` entity, `root: true` can be changed to other entity whichever required.
- Modify entity, service and any other full names as converted metadata will have only CAP entity names.
- Once final metadata is validated and modified according to guidelines of custom services metadata, upload feature can be used to upload the same.
