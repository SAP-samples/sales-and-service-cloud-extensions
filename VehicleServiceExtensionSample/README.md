## Description
This sample demonstrates side by side extension on Sales and Service Cloud for vehicle service scenario. Complete scenario details are mentioned in the section - [Reference Scenario](#reference-scenario).

We have created external application- service and UI, respectively. The service is developed using both **NodeJs** and **Java** and is interacting with SAP Sales and Service Cloud using SAP Cloud SDK. The service is deployed in a BTP Kyma instance. The UI is developed using SAP Build Apps, which is a no-code/low-code tool. The external UI is embedded in Sales and Service Cloud via mashups.


## Key Features
The key extension features covered in this implementation are:  
* Embedding external application in SAP Sales and Service Cloud via mashup
* External custom logic (validations/determinations) implementation using external hooks
* Few basic Extension configurations in SAP Sales and Service Cloud 
* User propagation across different applications
